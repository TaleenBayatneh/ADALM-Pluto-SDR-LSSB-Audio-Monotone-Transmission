# ADALM-Pluto SDR: LSSB Audio & Monotone Transmission

A **Software-Defined Radio (SDR) project** using the **ADALM-Pluto platform** to implement **Lower Single Sideband (LSSB) modulation**.  
The system transmits and receives both **monotone test signals** and **real-time audio**, with parameter optimization for improved performance.
